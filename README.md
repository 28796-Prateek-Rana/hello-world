# hello-world
Just another repository

Hi, I'm Prateek Rana, I like to play basketball and have a new-found love for coding.
I'm intrigued by data analysis and machine learning and the effect right now in the world and
what it is going to have in the future. I just joined GitHub, I'm learning how to use it.
Looking forward to some heavy usage of this platform!
